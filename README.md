# Large Multiplication Matrix using OPENMP
#### Problem Given: Develop an efficient large matrix multiplication algorithm in OpenMP. A prime criterion in the assessment of your assignment will be the efficiency of your implementation and the evidence you present to substantiate your claim that your implementations are efficient. Overall, develop an algorithm which can do Matrix Multiplication, where Large Matrix should be used to test performance via OPEN MP.

##### Solution: The Matrix Multiplication is a very challenging task for humans and as well as for computers machine also. As per the requirement of this assignment, OPENMP has been used in order to write an efficient large matrix multiplication algorithm, where according to the study, the most efficient algorithm is ikj-algorithm. In this work, Ikj-algorithm has been compared with the ijk-algorithm along with the traditional way of matrix multiplication, where execution time has been compared between these three.
